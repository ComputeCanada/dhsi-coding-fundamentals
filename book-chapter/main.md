No black boxes!

Use few, small, simple, universal, and powerful tools that you can hack and understand.

Wherever possible store data in human-readable text streams.

Do it right. Doing it badly accumulates intellectual, technological, and ethical debt.

If you have to do something more than once a hundred times,† automate.

Divide big problems into small, modular components.

Bootstrap and time well spent.‡

Keep poking, get help, take notes, comment, annotate, share, remix, and train others.

This chapter is intended for humanities-based researchers with no programming
background whatsoever who would like to understand how programs work behind the
scenes by writing some simple but useful programs of their own. Over the week
the emphasis will be on understanding how computer programmers think so that
participants will be able to at least participate in high-level conceptual
discussions in the future with more confidence. These general concepts will be
reinforced and illustrated with hands-on development of simple programs that
can be used to help with text-based research and analysis right away. The
language used for most of the course will be Python because of its gentle
syntax and powerful extensions. Using the command-line interface and regular
expressions will also be emphasized. We will also spend some time taking
glimpses at what is happening in the other DHSI courses to understand how
reading and writing programming code goes well beyond what we touch on in this
class.
