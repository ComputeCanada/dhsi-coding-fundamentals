In this chapter we elaborates a set of values, principles, and best practices
for digital humanities researchers and educators. We begin by describing a set
of core principles that guides our practice and methods. These principles
forward the values of humanistic inquiry, privileging transparency,
legibility, and critical engagement with the tools we use. At the same time,
they incorporate the ethos of the open source movement: the contents of a
digital humanist's toolkit should be modular, hackable, and universal. In the
next section, we outline a list of core competencies for the digital
humanities, including text markup, the command line, and programming
languages. Not all of these skills will be necessary for every DH
practitioner, but most large projects will require some engagement with each
area. Finally, we discuss three essential locations of critical computing: the
command line, Python, and a plain text editor. By “location,” we mean a site
of engagement with the machine, a unique interface with its own corresponding
affordances. By offering exercises for each of these locations, we introduce
the possibilities of each one for practice and pedagogy.
