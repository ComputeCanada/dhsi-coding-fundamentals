    "\n",
    "1. **Reduce the Data** -- Make your dataset as small as possible. Or parse and analyze it in chunks, rather than all at once. It is much easier to find an error in a small amount of data than in a huge amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cross-check Results** -- It's always useful to cross-check your results with what you *think* is suppose to be happening. For example, instead of printing an entire dataset, look at summaries. Or, if you're getting errors, check that the various values are of the correct types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Write Self-checks** -- A common method used by professional programmers is to write self-checks or sanity-checks into the code. These checks essentially make sure there's nothing funny going on. For example, if you know there are x number of words in a dataset, yet the sum of the values in your word count dictionary is greater than that number, there might be a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Make the Output Pretty** -- In other words, don't create error messages that make no sense, or are too vague. I think we've all experienced those types of error messages when using commercial software and know how annoying it is. If you're writing the code, make sure your error message are detailed enough to help you find and solve the problem."
