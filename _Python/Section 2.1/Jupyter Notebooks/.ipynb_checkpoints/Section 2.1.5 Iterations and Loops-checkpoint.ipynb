    "## A Note About Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loops** are wonderful tools in Python (and all other programming languages). **Loops** allow you to continue executing specific pieces of code as long as one or more condition meets a certain criteria. For example, a **loop** might continue to run the code inside it as long as the counter is under the count of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BEWARE:** **Loops** are awesome, but can also be the source of a lot of stress. If you do not code a **loop** properly, it might end up running FOREVER. If this happens, your computer will basically be stuck in the **loop** until it dies. If this happens, you'll need to manually stop the **loop** so you can make corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "To stop a **loop** in Jupyter Notebooks, you can click on the *stop* button in the toolbar at the top of the page. This *interrupts* the kernal (the area of your computer that is running the **loop**) so you can get control back. If that doesn't work, you can also click on the Kernal option in the menubar and *restart*, *reconnect*, or *shutdown* the kernal.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as you continue to save your work, you could even turn off your computer and restart it to get a really troublesome **loop** to stop. Well, technically, you don't have to save your work, but you'd lose whatever you didn't save if you had to restart your computer\n",
