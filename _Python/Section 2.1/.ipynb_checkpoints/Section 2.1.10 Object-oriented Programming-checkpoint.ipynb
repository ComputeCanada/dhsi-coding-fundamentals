    "### 1. Object-oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is considered an **object-oriented programming language**. That means it has the following charactertistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Program can include both class and method definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Most of the computations are expressed in terms of operations on objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Objects are represent things in the real world, and methods often correspond to real world interations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what doed that actually mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've built programs using *sequential code, conditional code* (i.e., if statements), *repetitive code* (i.e., loops), and *store and reuse functions*. We've used this code to **create** *data structures* and we've used this code to **manipulate** those *data structures*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our programs to date have been relatively small, maybe a dozen lines of code at the most. Those programs are relatively easy to understand by reading through the lines of code. *But what happens when you start writing programs that have hundreds or even thousands of lines of code?* At this level, it's important to write code that you can actually understand (and is well commented).\n",
    "\n",
    "But, how do we make code easier to understand? \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use **object-oriented programming** methods. Object-oriented programming can be used to break large pieces of code into small chunks that are easy to understand and focus on. When you're focusing on a specific object within your code, you can ignore the rest of your code.\n",

    "### 3. Program Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, all programs tend to do the same thing: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. They take some form of input.\n",
    "2. They process/manipulate/compute that input.\n",
    "3. They produce some output.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about your code in this way, you can see that you're actually programming *multiple sections/parts/zones* of code. We can ignore parts 2 and 3 while we're writing part 1. We can ignore parts 1 and 3 when we're writing part 2. And we can ignore parts 1 and 2 when writing part 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"hard core\" programming world, there may even be separate programmers working on each of these parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways, we don't have to know, or even care, about the parts of the program we're not currently working on, including built-in functions. For example, exactly how does the **print()** function work? Do we care? As long as it works and does what we expect, why do we need to know the details? The answer, we don't.\n",
    "\n",
