# Fundamentals of Programming/Coding for Human(s|ists)
John Simpson and Dennis Tenen

This course is intended for humanities-based researchers with no programming
background whatsoever who would like to understand how programs work behind the
scenes by writing some simple but useful programs of their own. Over the week
the emphasis will be on understanding how computer programmers think so that
participants will be able to at least participate in high-level conceptual
discussions in the future with more confidence. These general concepts will be
reinforced and illustrated with hands-on development of simple programs that
can be used to help with text-based research and analysis right away. The
language used for most of the course will be Python because of its gentle
syntax and powerful extensions. Using the command-line interface and regular
expressions will also be emphasized. We will also spend some time taking
glimpses at what is happening in the other DHSI courses to understand how
reading and writing programming code goes well beyond what we touch on in this
class.

Consider this offering in complement with, and / or to be built on by:
Out-of-the-Box Text Analysis for the Digital Humanities; Geographical
Information Systems in the Digital Humanities; Physical Computing and Desktop
Fabrication; Data Mining for Digital Humanists; Understanding Topic Modelling;
Stylometry with R: Computer-Assisted Analysis of Literary Texts; RDF and Linked
Open Data; 3d Modelling for DH and Social Sciences; DH Databases; Creating LAMP
Infrastructure for Digital Humanities Projects; A Collaborative Approach to
XSLT; and more!

## Day 1 (4hr)

Lab: Hunting the Whale. Weasel Words.

## Day 2 (6hr)

Lecture:
- How to think like a programmer
- Pseudocode
- Variables
- Data types
- Control structures
- Conditionals
- Where to get help

Intro to the Terminal and Python Programming. Terminal in the morning via a
cheatsheet, a bit of a live demo, and then some problems that they can use the
cheatsheet to solve. This then moves to terminal based python programming and
some challenges in the afternoon. I used a live coding demo to show how to
build an simple tool to tell you your Chinese zodiac symbol that they were able
to follow along with (You can see the steps for this in the zodiac folder).
This day was popular as the direct use of terminal and python gave participants
a sense of control and authority that they did not previously have.

Lab: Some assignment.

## Day 3 (6hr)

Lecture:
- PyCharm
- methods
- libraries
- nltk
- text manipulation
- code and data

Python Workbench.  There was a little bit of carry over from the
previous day and following this they were introduced to PyCharm CE (It was
available on all the platforms and has a clean interface). At noon they were
given a choice of projects to work on that included projects that they may have
brought.  Groups would then go through the process of planning their code and
then writing and testing sections in increments with the goal of being ready to
provide a show and tell by Friday afternoonâ€™s show and tell. Participants
really liked PyCharm and having seen the command line version previously seemed
to help remove the mysticism that can accompany a tool like this when coming
to programming from nothing.

Lab: Projects brainstorm. A few canned projects. Text adventure and/or twitter
bot.

## Day 4 (6hr)

Lab all day.

## Day 5 (3hr)

Lab all day. Where to go from here. Resources. Paths to development.
