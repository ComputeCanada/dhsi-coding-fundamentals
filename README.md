This course is intended for humanities-based researchers with no programming
background whatsoever who would like to understand how programs work behind the
scenes by writing some simple but useful programs of their own. Over the week
the emphasis will be on understanding how computer programmers think so that
participants will be able to at least participate in high-level conceptual
discussions in the future with more confidence. These general concepts will be
reinforced and illustrated with hands-on development of simple programs that
can be used to help with text-based research and analysis right away. The
language used for most of the course will be Python because of its gentle
syntax and powerful extensions. Using the command-line interface and regular
expressions will also be emphasized. We will also spend some time taking
glimpses at what is happening in the other DHSI courses to understand how
reading and writing programming code goes well beyond what we touch on in this
class.

Consider this offering in complement with, and / or to be built on by:
Out-of-the-Box Text Analysis for the Digital Humanities; Geographical
Information Systems in the Digital Humanities; Physical Computing and Desktop
Fabrication; Data Mining for Digital Humanists; Understanding Topic Modelling;
Stylometry with R: Computer-Assisted Analysis of Literary Texts; RDF and Linked
Open Data; 3d Modelling for DH and Social Sciences; DH Databases; Creating LAMP
Infrastructure for Digital Humanities Projects; A Collaborative Approach to
XSLT; and more!

## Day 1 (4hr)

Morning (10:15am-12:00pm)
- Welcome (John & Dennis)
  - Introductions
  - Overview of week
- Working Demo: Introduction to Terminal (John)
  - Cheatsheet
  - Regex
  - Simple problems using the cheatsheet

Afternoon (1:30pm-4:00pm)
- Lab: [Weasel Words][4], [Hunting the Whale][5]. (Dennis)

Intro to the Terminal. Terminal in the morning via a cheatsheet, a bit of a live 
demo, and then some problems that they can use the cheatsheet to solve.  Use of lab
activities in the afternoon that will push further into text manipulation in a Unix environment that is akin to what they might actually do with materials.

## Day 2 (6hr)

Morning (9:00am-12:00pm)
- Lecture / Working Demo (Carry over): Thinking like a computer programmer. (John)
  - Pseudocode
  - Variables
  - Data types
  - Control structures
  - Conditionals
  - Where to get help
- Live programming demo (John)
  - Zodiac Tool

Afternoon (1:30pm-4:00pm)
- Lab: NLTK and other powerful things (Dennis)
- Working Demo (Depending on progress): Introducing A Workbench (John)

Light lecture in the morning that builds on experiences the day before, focusing on
the mindset of a programmer and important high-level programming concepts.  Following this will be a small set of activities using python solely in the terminal to give a sense of how these concepts are implemented generally.  The second part of the morning will include a live coding demo using python in the terminal and a text editor in a separate window to show how to build an simple tool (Previously this was a Chinese zodiac symbol that participants will be able to follow along with. See the zodiac folder for these steps).  This provides two essential things: observation of an actual coding process and a set of templates that they can draw on for the rest of the course (and afterwards).  

The afternoon will have them carrying out a lab assignment to further hone their skills.

[To consider: introducing the python workbench at the end of the afternoon to allow for the class to move forward faster on day three by allowing the focus of the afternoon to be the basics of the interface and the focus of the next morning to be some of the bells and whistles (like libraries) that have previously been ignored.]

## Day 3 (6hr)

Morning (9:00am-12:00pm)
- Working Demo (Depending on progress): Introducing A Workbench (John)
- Lab / Lecture: Extending the power of Python (Dennis)
  - methods
  - libraries
  - text manipulation
  - code and data

Afternoon (1:30pm-4:00pm)
- Begin projects.

Belaid Moa (A Compute Canada Analyst) has offered to come in and do a quick "How to use our servers" which would give them the possibility of increase computing power.  It could be part of day 3.

Python Workbench.  There was a little bit of carry over from the
previous day and following this they were introduced to PyCharm CE (It was
available on all the platforms and has a clean interface). At noon they were
given a choice of projects to work on that included projects that they may have
brought.  Groups would then go through the process of planning their code and
then writing and testing sections in increments with the goal of being ready to
provide a show and tell by Friday afternoonâ€™s show and tell. Participants
really liked PyCharm and having seen the command line version previously seemed
to help remove the mysticism that can accompany a tool like this when coming
to programming from nothing.

Lab: Projects brainstorm. A few canned projects. Text adventure and/or twitter
bot.  Other classes may have work that this class can contribute to (CWRC is a likely source).  Students could also bring their own project.

## Day 4 (6hr)

Project work all day.

## Day 5 (3hr)

Project work all morning and project presentations in the afternoon. Where to go from here. Resources. Paths to development.
